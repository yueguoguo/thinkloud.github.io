2020 has been a special year to everyone. Despite losing opportunities to travel
across the world, meeting people, and attending physical conferences, I was
lucky to grow with tremendous learning through the challenging yet enjoyable
life. I summarized what I appreciated the most in my learnings of the year as
below.

## Implement Innovation

I worked in the industry that progresses pressingly and rapidly. Innovative
mindset had occupied my head for quite some time. Inspired by the famous
"creating the future" quote, I pushed myself to be up with the most advanced
technology to make sure that I am always cutting the edge. I realized the
importance of "implementing" the idea when I found it hard to find the value
proposition of *just* innovating after I started to work more like a product
developer than a scientist. Many times *implementation is more privotal than, or
at least, equally important to, innovation*. Sparkling a new idea may cost
research, dialectic, critics, etc., which can usually be achieved by an
individual. Implementing a good idea, however, requires inspiration, execution,
collaboration, operationalization, and maybe even more. All of these
constructively force the stuff that is being built move towards something that
is really useful and meaningful to its audience. And, this can only be achieved
by a team. From innovation to implementation, it is not just a switch of mindset
and/or skillset, cognitively it is also a transfer from self-centerness to
open-mindedness. Being a part of the team helps boost the process of
implementation.

## Keep the communication going

Pandemic makes it hard for people to collaborate effectively due to reduced
chance of face to face meeting. The key to being collaboratively efficient is
that whoever is involved in the work together should *keep the communication
going*. One of the techniques for developers to keep good communication rolling
is ["Pair Programming"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming).
Broadly, the communciation may refer to either the conversation in the pair
programming session, discussion offline in the GitHub issues tab, or messages in
the communication platform. A pair programming session often involves at least
two people joining into the same session, where one can take the drive of
developement while the other can help review it. I can be fully productive with
the help of the tools like Microsoft Teams, GitHub, Visual Studio Code with a
remote connection to the server, etc., to conduct a pair programming session
with my colleagues. The code assets can be either lively shared or synchronized
offline with the peer in the pair programming session conveniently. Pair
programming keeps a proper level of tense and flexibility in the session. It
catalysts the interaction between the developers in the same meeting and
products positive feedback to each other. It helps spot and resolve challenging
technical issues quickly even if people inolved in the session do not meet at
person, and therefore it maintains the agility of software development
practices.

## Be Adaptive

The pandemic of COVID-19 has made lots of changes in the world.
