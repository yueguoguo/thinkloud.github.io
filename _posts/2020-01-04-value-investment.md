## Value Investment

Value investing is one of the commonly used strategies in stock investment. I am not a professional in financial investment, so the article is not to share my investment strategy in the financial market. It is instead about how I borrow the philosophy in value investing to direct myself in the exploration in the technology domain.

In general, the core idea of value investing is to recognize a stock with true value whilst it is commonly underestimated by the masses. This idea can be unfolded into two major point. 

* True value.
* Underestimation.

### True Value
It is apparent that good investment usually requires the investor to at least have the expertise and knowledge in the field in order to thoroughly understand the value of the stock. Definitely investing often involves speculative acts but identifying a good stock with true value, or the other way round, a bad stock with appearingly true value (you can short it) is vital to getting expected returns. 

### Underestimation
It is easy to get trapped in the mainstream ideas surrounding you and lose the personal views on a particular object. One thing I have learnt from the famous investor, Peter Lynch, in his book, is that, "If your neighbors start to talk about some stock, avoid buying them". It is not hard to understand the logic - as the market surpasses its hype and everyone is aware of its value, the competition is high and the true value of the stock is diluted. 

## How It Works In Technological Domain

The same idea used in value investing applies to directing my research and development in the technology domain. One can easily find the similarities between the two fields. For example, a Ph.D student may ask the professor about which area to start with for his academic research; a technological firm manager may ask his advisors about which technology they should use for maximum profits. Corresponding to the strategies in value investing, I found that the same methods can be used in solving the direction problems in the technology domain. Again, one just needs to find the **true value** of a technology that is currently underestimated by the masses.



There are a few sources where you can get the information to recognize the true value of technologies.

* *Follow the research of well-known institute*
Thanks to the training in Ph.D., I am still keeping the habit of reading academic research articles. 

* *Keep an eye on the activities of Venture Capitalists*

The thoughts in this post originates from my recent research on [recommendation system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system) and a conversation with one of my friends who is an architect and philosopher.  

The problem of technology (esp. AI) rebellion was realized when people find that the received information starts to bias them towards an unexpected direction. Think about the exposure to the infinite virtual space that is made of social media network. Intelligent algorithms are created on purpose to redistribute "relevant" information to users according to learnt paths. The intelligent algorithm, which is usually based on a mathematical representation of the human behavior or human beings themselves, has potential to create bias.

## Dimensionality reduction 

The core idea of representing complex physical object in the machine world is information compression<sup>[1]</sup>. For example, a man can be described by a few traits with which the man can be differentiated from another one. This idea works well in many tasks. For example, shops usually do [customer segmentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_segmentation) in the marketing strategy in order to precisely promote products to the target group of audience. Though the algorithm usually assumes penalties for making a wrong prediction (segmentation) to reduce the risk. To the users that are exposed to the service that is built upon the algorithm, the effect is that some users may be unconsciously influenced by the inaccurate results generated from the algorithm, and this in turn, produces undesired bias into users' mind.

## Personality and individuality

Researchers in the AI domain are longing for a ["strong" intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence) that can solve the aforementioned problem. From the perspective of a technologist, a simple idea to avoid homogeneity in the information flow is to increase the dimensionality of information representation. For example, researchers are trying to build knowledge graph (e.g., Wikidata from Wikipedia)<sup>[2]</sup> to enhance the interpretability of an intelligent model, so that it can largely reconcile the information in the original entity. Reflected in the learning process of a human being, gaining new knowledge is always the best way to keep personality and individuality in the society. It helps keep an individual from drowning in the information flow where he may be directed unconsciously<sup>[3]</sup>.

## Democratization of technology

As a developer, researcher, and practitioner, it is responsibility and morality to maintain the transparency of any innovation. The transformation process of technology should take place with enough awareness of its audience. The consumers of technology hold the right to choose using a technology or not. Technology is meant to "re-engineer" human beings in some way. However, humans should proactively control the re-engineering process, and the ultimate objective of the re-engineering process is to strengthen, augment, enhance, etc., and this can only happens if the basics of a technology that leads to transformation is well understood. 

## 2050

The view points above were shared in the ["Body and City" forum](https://2050.org.cn/new-gen-forum-at2019/body-city-porous-and-super-scale-city-adventures/) at [2050](https://2050.org.cn/). It represents my personal opinions, and has nothing to do with the organization that I am working in. 

Thanks to the organizer and panel members for the discussion.
