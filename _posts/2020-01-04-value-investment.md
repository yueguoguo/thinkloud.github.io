## Value Investment

Value investing is one of the commonly used strategies in stock investment. I am not a professional in financial investment, so the article is not to share my investment strategy in the financial market. It is instead about how I borrow the philosophy in value investing to direct myself in the exploration in the technology domain.

In general, the core idea of value investing is to recognize a stock with true value whilst it is commonly underestimated by the masses. This idea can be unfolded into two major point. 

* **True value**.
* **Underestimation**.

### True Value
It is apparent that good investment usually requires the investor to at least have the expertise and knowledge in the field in order to thoroughly understand the value of the stock. Definitely investing often involves speculative acts but identifying a good stock with true value, or the other way round, a bad stock with appearingly true value (you can short it) is vital to getting expected returns. 

### Underestimation
It is easy to get trapped in the mainstream ideas surrounding you and lose the personal views on a particular object. One thing I have learnt from the famous investor, Peter Lynch, in his book, is that, "If your neighbors start to talk about some stock, avoid buying them" <sup>[1]</sup>. It is not hard to understand the logic - as the market surpasses its hype and everyone is aware of its value, the competition is high and the true value of the stock is diluted. 

## How It Works In Technological Domain

The same idea used in value investing can be applied to directing my research and development in the technology domain. One can easily find the similarities between the two fields. For example, a Ph.D student may ask the professor about which area to start with for his academic research; a technological firm manager may ask his advisors about which technology they should use for maximum profits. Corresponding to the strategies in value investing, the same methods can be used in solving the direction problems in the technology domain. Again, generally, one just needs to find the **true value** of a technology that is **currently underestimated** by the masses.

To be more specific, there are a few 

* *Follow the research of well-known institute*
Thanks to the training in Ph.D., I am still keeping the habit of reading academic research articles.

* *Keep an eye on the capital flow*

Sometimes, the profits from the technologies are not from the technologies themselves but the marketing trend which is influenced by other forces, like capital flow. Capitalists invest start-up companies with high value at low price. Studying the investing list of a VC gives you insight about which area is having the potential to become a unicorn in the near future - it compensates the self-learning on the academic research in a way that, compared to scholars, VCs care about whether the company can be commerciall successful. If the companies to be invested in are tech companies, it might imply that the technologies developed or used by the companies are promising. 

I have learnt quite a lot from one of my favorite [podcasts from Andreessen Horowitz (A16Z)](https://a16z.com/2019/12/31/our-top-10-podcasts-of-2019/). Similar sources are [podcasts from YC Combinator](https://blog.ycombinator.com/category/podcast/), [newsletters from Sequoia](https://www.sequoiacap.com/newsletter), etc.

* *Be persistent but not stubborn*

It is important to be persistent on a technology until it becomes rewarding. For the first time Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts created the subject of "neural network" with a computational model<sup>[3]</sup>. The technology has experienced several technological evolution till the year of 2019 when Geoffrey Hinton, Yan LeCun, and Yoshua Bengio were awarded with Turing Award for their contributions to the development and large-scale application of deep neural network, which to a large extent, recognized the success of the technology<sup>[4]</sup>. 

The persistence does not mean complete rejection against any transformation. A "growth mindset" is usually needed to accompany the persistence and help make adjustment when necessary.
